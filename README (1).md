# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – All-in-One Project

This repository contains a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** project implemented in a single Jupyter Notebook.
The notebook demonstrates how a Data Scientist approaches **raw data, cleans it, explores patterns, visualizes insights, and derives meaningful conclusions** across multiple real-world datasets.

This project is designed to showcase **end-to-end EDA skills** and serve as a strong **portfolio project for internships and entry-level Data Scientist / Data Analyst roles**.
